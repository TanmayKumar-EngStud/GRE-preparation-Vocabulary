Ah, "futile"! Let's explore the concept of fruitless effort and lack of success with this word!

Usage: When something is "futile," it's like trying to catch a rainbow—it means the effort is pointless, incapable of producing the desired result or outcome.

Etymology: The word "futile" comes from the Latin word "futilis," which means "vain" or "worthless." It's like describing an action or endeavor that is ultimately without purpose or value.

Playful Example:
Mickey: "Hey, Goofy, why did the marathon runner try to outrun a snail?"
Goofy: "I dunno, Mickey, why?"
Mickey: "Because he thought he could defy gravity and achieve the impossible, but alas, his attempt was futile—like trying to turn Minnie's polka dots into solid colors!"

Remember, it's all in good fun! If you have another word or character you'd like me to use, just say the word, and we'll keep the playful banter going!
