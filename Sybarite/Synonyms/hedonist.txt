Ah, "hedonist"! Let's explore the concept of pleasure-seeking and self-indulgence with this word!

Usage: When someone is described as a "hedonist," it's like they have a radar for fun and enjoymentâ€”it refers to a person who believes that the pursuit of pleasure and personal gratification is the ultimate goal in life.

Etymology: The word "hedonist" comes from the Greek word "hedone," which means "pleasure" or "delight." It's like describing someone who prioritizes their own happiness and seeks pleasurable experiences above all else.

Playful Example:
Mickey: "Hey, Donald, why did the hedonist carry around a picnic basket full of chocolate all the time?"
Donald: "I don't know, Mickey, why?"
Mickey: "Because for the hedonist, life was one big chocolate-filled adventure. From chocolate fountains to chocolate-covered everything, their motto was 'life is sweet, and I'm the candy connoisseur!'"

Remember, it's all in good fun! If you have another word or character you'd like me to use, just say the word, and we'll keep the playful banter going!
