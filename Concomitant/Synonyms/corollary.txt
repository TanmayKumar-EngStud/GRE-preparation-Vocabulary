Ah, "corollary"! Let's unravel the logical connections with this word!

Usage: When something is a "corollary," it's like Mickey's big shoesâ€”they're inseparable and naturally follow from what came before, just like a logical conclusion.

Etymology: The word "corollary" comes from the Latin word "corollarium," which means "consequence" or "deduction." It's like when one idea follows naturally from another, forming a logical relationship.

Playful Example:
Mickey: "Hey, Goofy, why did the umbrella refuse to go out in the rain?"
Goofy: "I don't know, Mickey, why?"
Mickey: "Because it realized that the corollary of opening up would be getting soaked and turned into a 'raincoat stand' instead!"

Remember, it's all in good fun! If you have another word or character you'd like me to use, just say the word, and we'll keep the playful banter going!
