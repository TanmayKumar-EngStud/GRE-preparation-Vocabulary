Ah, "ancillary"! Let's explore the supporting role of this word!

Usage: When something is "ancillary," it's like Chip and Dale assisting Mickey in his adventuresâ€”they play a secondary but important role, providing support and complementing the main event.

Etymology: The word "ancillary" comes from the Latin word "ancilla," which means "handmaid" or "servant." It's like when something serves as a helpful addition or supporting component to something else.

Playful Example:
Mickey: "Hey, Chip, why did the broom get a job at the theater?"
Chip: "I don't know, Mickey, why?"
Mickey: "Because it wanted to be the ancillary star, sweeping the audience off their feet with its show-stopping performance!"

Remember, it's all in good fun! If you have another word or character you'd like me to use, just say the word, and we'll keep the playful banter going!
