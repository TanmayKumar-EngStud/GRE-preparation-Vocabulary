Ah, "cogent"! Let's bring some clarity and wit to this word!

Usage: When something is "cogent," it's like a well-crafted plan by Mickey and his friendsâ€”clear, logical, and convincing.

Etymology: The word "cogent" comes from the Latin word "cogens," which means "compelling" or "convincing." It's like when an argument or explanation is so strong that it can't be ignored.

Playful Example:
Mickey: "Hey, Goofy, why did the book win the debate competition?"
Goofy: "I dunno, Mickey. Why?"
Mickey: "Because its cogent arguments had everyone turning pages in agreement, leaving no plot hole unaddressed!"

Remember, it's all in good fun! If you have another word or character you'd like me to use, just say the word, and we'll keep the playful banter going!
