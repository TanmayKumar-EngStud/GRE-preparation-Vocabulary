Ah, "shrewd"! Let's bring some cleverness and wit to this word!

Usage: When someone is "shrewd," it's like Scrooge McDuck making a smart financial decision—astute, cunning, and always one step ahead.

Etymology: The word "shrewd" comes from the Old English word "scrēawian," meaning "to scrutinize" or "to observe closely." It's like when someone is sharp-minded and perceptive.

Playful Example:
Mickey: "Hey, Donald, why did the money tree start giving advice?"
Donald: "I don't know, Mickey, why?"
Mickey: "Because it became shrewd and realized it could grow wealthier by sharing its 'leafy' wisdom with others!"

Remember, it's all in good fun! If you have another word or character you'd like me to use, just say the word, and we'll keep the playful banter going!
