Ah, "jejune," huh? Let's have some fun with that!

Usage: When something is "jejune," it's like a joke that even Goofy wouldn't find funny. It means it's dull, immature, or lacking substance.

Etymology: The word "jejune" comes from the Latin word "jejunus," meaning "empty" or "lacking." It's like a plate of plain oatmeal without any toppingsâ€”bland and unexciting.

Playful Example: 
Mickey: "Hey, Goofy, why did the bicycle fall over?"
Goofy: "I don't know, Mickey. Why?"
Mickey: "Because it found the joke so 'jejune' that it couldn't even keep its balance!"

Remember, it's all in good fun! If you have another word or character you'd like me to use, just say the word, and we'll keep the playful banter going!
