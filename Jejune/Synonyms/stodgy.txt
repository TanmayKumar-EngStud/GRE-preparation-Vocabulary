Ah, "stodgy"! Let's bring some lightness to this word!

Usage: When something is "stodgy," it's like Goofy trying to do balletâ€”clumsy, awkward, and lacking grace or elegance.

Etymology: The word "stodgy" originated from the British dialectal word "stodged," meaning "to be overfilled" or "to be excessively solid or heavy." It's like when something feels heavy and cumbersome.

Playful Example:
Mickey: "Hey, Goofy, why did the potato go to the gym?"
Goofy: "I dunno, Mickey. Why?"
Mickey: "Because it was tired of being called stodgy and wanted to get into shape, so it could be a 'mashed-terpiece' instead!"

Remember, it's all in good fun! If you have another word or character you'd like me to use, just say the word, and we'll keep the playful banter going!
