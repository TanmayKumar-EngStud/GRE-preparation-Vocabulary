# For improvement of your vocabulary.

Here is the presentation where there are few questions, with some hard words. 
1. Now my approach is to learn the new words is to create an image inside our mind for that word.
2. Every day write the words that you have learnt so far, and also when you are writing the word, try to recall that image in your mind.
3. Practice this everyday, and you will remember all these words. (This will be in such a way that whenever you encounter this word you will be able to remember the meaning of it) 

## BUT!!

I believe that even after this, I am sometimes not able to use these words in my daily life, for this I think is that the best way is to just use these words as much as possible. <br>
Or give some additional time in thinking of a sentence for the words at the time you are writing the word. <br>
Initially you will think that this is really a slow process, But you will slowly get faster in it. <br>

## Contribute?

In order to contribute you must have one book with good questions like this, and then create your own ppt, and share it in this repository. <br>
But you have to confirm about one thing that you are not recreating the same words in you presentations. <br>
Thank you!
