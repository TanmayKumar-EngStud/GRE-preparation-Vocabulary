Ah, "moribund"! Let's explore the state of decline and fading away with this word!

Usage: When something is "moribund," it's like a wilting flower on the verge of withering awayâ€”it's in a state of decline or near-death, lacking vitality or vigor.

Etymology: The word "moribund" comes from the Latin word "moribundus," which means "dying" or "at the point of death." It's like describing something that is on the brink of extinction or no longer thriving.

Playful Example:
Mickey: "Hey, Pluto, why did the party balloon look so sad?"
Pluto: *tilts head sympathetically*
Mickey: "Because it felt moribund after the festivities, realizing that its days of floating high and making people smile were slowly deflating!"

Remember, it's all in good fun! If you have another word or character you'd like me to use, just say the word, and we'll keep the playful banter going!
